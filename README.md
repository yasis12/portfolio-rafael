# Rafael Yasis - Web Developer Portfolio

Hello, I'm Rafael Yasis, a marketing graduate making a transition into the world of software development. I have a passion for building solutions that save time and enhance user experiences. With a Full Stack Engineering certificate from Prime Digital Academy, I am excited to showcase my journey and skills through this portfolio.

I thrive on learning, working under pressure, and fostering strong communication and accountability in every project.
